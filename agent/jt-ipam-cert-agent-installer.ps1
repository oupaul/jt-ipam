.SYNOPSIS
  Install / update / remove the jt-ipam certificate distribution agent on Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
  Downloads the agent from your jt-ipam server, writes a config file, and registers a daily
  scheduled task that runs it as SYSTEM. Windows PowerShell 5.1 (built into Windows Server
  2019 and later) is all that is required -- no extra modules.

  Run from an elevated PowerShell prompt:

    $env:JT_IPAM_SERVER = "https://ipam.example.com"
    $env:JT_IPAM_AGENT_KEY = "<enrollment key from the jt-ipam cert agent page>"
    $env:JT_IPAM_INSECURE = "1"   # only if the jt-ipam server certificate is self-signed
    iwr -UseBasicParsing "$env:JT_IPAM_SERVER/api/v1/cert-agents/installer.ps1" | iex

  Or, having saved this file:

    .\jt-ipam-cert-agent-installer.ps1 -Server https://ipam.example.com -AgentKey <key>

.PARAMETER Uninstall
  Remove the scheduled task and the installed files. Certificates already imported into the
  Windows certificate store are left alone -- they are in use.
